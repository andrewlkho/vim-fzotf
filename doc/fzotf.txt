INTRODUCTION                                                           *fzotf*

This plugin is a tool for inserting citation keys, extracted from Zotero, into
a document (usually LaTeX).  It uses |fzf| as a fuzzy finder interface for
selecting the citation key to insert.

Features:

1. Queries the Zotero database directly, so if an item is added to Zotero
while editing in vim, it is immediately available to be cited

2. Uses fzf to search any part of the citation (author, journal, title etc) to
reduce the mental friction when recalling the article

3. Insert multiple citations at the same time using multiple selections in fzf


INSTALLATION                                              *fzotf-installation*

vim-fzotf requires the Better BibTeX extension for Zotero to be installed.
This ensures that citation keys are stable between exports.

vim-fzotf also requires the fzf plugin.  If you are using vim-plug:
>
  Plug 'junegunn/fzotf'
  Plug 'andrewlkho/vim-fzotf'

CONFIGURATION                                            *fzotf-configuration*

                                                              *g:fzotf_zotdir*
The location of the Zotero data directory. This is set in Zotero under
Preferences > Advanced > Files and Folders > Data Directory Location. The
default value in vim-fzotf is the Zotero-default of ~/Zotero but if you have
changed this you can set it with:
>
  let g:fzotf_zotdir = '~/Documents/Zotero'
<
                                                             *g:fzotf_options*
Options to pass to |fzf#run|. The default is --multi. I like to only have
exact matches of each word as I often think in whole words when summoning up a
citation, so I have set it to:
>
  let g:fzotf_options = '--multi --exact'
<

USAGE                                                            *fzotf-usage*

By default, vim-fzotf does not map any keybindings.  Instead, it provides
<Plug>FZotF.  For example, I put the following in my ftplugin/tex.vim:
>
  imag <buffer> <C-F> <Plug>FZotF
>

So that pressing <C-F> in insert mode launches the citation key selector.


ISSUES                                                          *fzotf-issues*

vim-fzotf works for my library, but I appreciate that many people put a
diverse range of items in their Zotero library. If something doesn't work for
you then please file an issue via GitHub:
